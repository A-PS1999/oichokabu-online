## Oicho Kabu Online

### ðŸŽ´ ~~Visit the site: https://oichokabu-online.herokuapp.com/~~ Currently not hosted

### Description
A client side and server side for my implementation of the tradiitonal Japanese card game, oicho kabu. Users create an account and can create a game room with various settings (e.g. number of players, max number of rounds and bets). 

People can join an open room and, using websockets, receive updates on page state in real time. Using the game logic set up on the backend, it's possible to play a full game of oicho kabu. The state of players' chips is saved at the end of a game and the number can be reset if it gets too low.

### Technologies used
* React
* SCSS for styling, with a few libraries for certain components
* Redux Toolkit for state management
* Node and Express.js backend
* Socket.io
* PostgreSQL database via Sequelize ORM
